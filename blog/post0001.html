      <h2>The Best Native Trees for Oklahoma</h2>

      <img src="../img/Oklahoma_Tallgrass_Prairie.jpg" alt="Oklahoma Tallgrass Prairie">

      <p>When designing a sustainable and resilient landscape in Oklahoma, choosing native trees is one of the best decisions you can make. Native trees are well adapted to the region’s climate, soil, and weather extremes, making them more drought-resistant, pest-resistant, and beneficial to local wildlife. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best native trees for Oklahoma landscapes, highlighting their unique characteristics and how they can enhance your property.</p>

      <h3>Why Choose Native Trees?</h3>
      <p>Native trees offer several advantages over non-native species, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Drought Tolerance:</b> Adapted to Oklahoma’s climate, native trees require less water once established.</li>
        <li><b>Wildlife Habitat:</b> They provide food and shelter for birds, pollinators, and other beneficial species.</li>
        <li><b>Soil Adaptability:</b> Native trees thrive in Oklahoma’s varied soil conditions, from clay to sandy loam.</li>
        <li><b>Low Maintenance:</b> They require fewer fertilizers and pesticides than many non-native species.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By planting native trees, you contribute to Oklahoma’s ecological health while enjoying a beautiful and functional landscape.</p>

      <h3>Planting and Caring for Native Trees</h3>
      <p>To ensure success when planting native trees in Oklahoma, follow these best practices:</p>

      <h4>1. Choose the Right Location</h4>
      <p>Each tree has different space and sunlight needs. Research your chosen tree’s mature size and plant accordingly to avoid overcrowding.</p>

      <h4>2. Plant at the Right Time</h4>
      <p>The best time to plant trees in Oklahoma is during the fall or early spring when temperatures are mild and roots can establish before summer heat arrives.</p>

      <h4>3. Water During Establishment</h4>
      <p>While native trees are drought-tolerant, they still need regular watering for the first 1–2 years until their root systems develop.</p>

      <h4>4. Mulch Properly</h4>
      <p>Applying a 2–4 inch layer of mulch around the base of the tree helps retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Be sure to keep mulch away from the trunk to prevent rot.</p>

      <h4>5. Prune for Structure</h4>
      <p>Regular pruning helps maintain a strong structure and removes any diseased or weak branches. Prune during the dormant season to reduce stress on the tree.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Selecting native trees for your Oklahoma landscape is a smart and sustainable choice. Whether you need shade, wildlife habitat, or ornamental beauty, native species like Bur Oak, Eastern Redbud, and Pecan offer a range of benefits. By planting these resilient trees, you’ll enjoy a thriving landscape that supports the local ecosystem while enhancing your property for generations to come.</p>
