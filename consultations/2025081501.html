  <h1>Retaining Wall Assessment Report</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This report evaluates the structural and functional integrity of the retaining wall installed along the fence line prior to recent horticultural work. Based on visual inspection and site conditions, the wall appears to be improperly constructed and is already showing signs of failure. The observations outlined below indicate that the structure does not meet typical best practices or functional requirements for a retaining wall.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lack of Structural Reinforcement:</strong> No evidence of geogrid, rebar, or vertical anchoring. Corner blocks appear loosely mortared or glued.</li>
      <li><strong>No Drainage System:</strong> No weep holes or perforated drain tile observed. Water stains indicate hydrostatic pressure buildup.</li>
      <li><strong>Improper Footing/Base:</strong> Blocks appear to rest directly on soil, rather than a compacted gravel or concrete base.</li>
      <li><strong>Gaps and Cracks Between Blocks:</strong> Several visible gaps and voids indicate movement or poor compaction underneath.</li>
      <li><strong>Wall Movement and Bulging:</strong> The wall bows toward the fence, suggesting soil pressure is causing deformation.</li>
      <li><strong>Inappropriate Use of Cap Blocks:</strong> Caps appear cosmetic and misaligned, with gaps that can allow water infiltration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This structure does <strong>not meet the functional or structural criteria</strong> for a proper retaining wall. It appears to have been built with cosmetic priority rather than engineering soundness, and it may pose a risk of partial or total failure over time.</p>
    <p>If left unaddressed, this could lead to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Damage to fencing or nearby structures</li>
      <li>Soil erosion and washout</li>
      <li>Loss of plantings and landscaping</li>
      <li>Potential liability due to collapse</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Request that the original contractor rebuild the wall with proper engineering, drainage, and anchoring.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, bring in a qualified retaining wall specialist to correct the installation.</li>
      <li>If legal or formal dispute arises, hire a licensed engineer to produce a stamped structural report.</li>
      <li>Postpone planting high-value materials near this wall until stability is confirmed.</li>
    </ul>
